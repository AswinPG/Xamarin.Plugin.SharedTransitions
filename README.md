#### What is a shared element transition?
Shared element transitions are animations connecting common elements from one page to another.<br>
A shared element transition determines how elements that are present in two pages transition between them.
For example, an image that is displayed on both Page A and Page B, transitions from A to B when B becomes visible.

## New Sample apps!
The sample apps have been completely rewritten: you can find examples for images & layouts, as well as dynamic examples (for both listview with DataTemplateSelector & collectionview).
Every example is available in standard pages, tabbed, master detail and shell.


The main app is made with [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism) and it sports the superawesome [PancakeView](https://github.com/sthewissen/Xamarin.Forms.PancakeView/) and [FFImageLoading](https://github.com/luberda-molinet/FFImageLoading) plugins!

*Note: Yes my dog is supercute and deserve her sample app :D*
